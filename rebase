🌱 Imagine this scenario:

You have two branches:

main (the main project branch)

feature (your branch where you’re adding a new feature)

🔹 Situation without rebase

Let’s say the history looks like this:

A --- B --- C   (main)
       \
        D --- E   (feature)


Commits A, B, C are in main.

Commits D, E are in your feature branch.

While you were working on feature, someone else added commit C to main.

🔹 What git rebase main does

If you run this command while on the feature branch:

git checkout feature
git rebase main


Git will move commits D and E so that they come after C, like this:

A --- B --- C   (main)
                \
                 D' --- E'   (feature rebased)


Now it looks like you started your work from the latest main commit.

🔑 Why this is useful

History is clean and linear (no branching lines).

It looks like you developed your feature on top of the newest main.

When you later merge feature into main, it’s just a “fast-forward” (no merge commit).

⚠️ Important note

git rebase rewrites commit history (creates new commits D' and E' instead of the old ones).

That’s why it’s safe to rebase your local branches but not good to rebase commits you already pushed to a shared remote repo (others might get confused).

✅ In short:

Merge = “combine branches, keep history as is (can look messy).”

Rebase = “pretend I started from the latest main, replay my work on top (clean history).”

⚠️ Why not rebase in a team?

Because rebase rewrites history.
If you already pushed commits to a remote branch that others have pulled, rebasing will “change the past” → and your teammates will end up with two different versions of the same commits.

🔹 Example Scenario
1. You and your teammate start from the same branch

Branch: feature

You both pull it at the same time.

A --- B --- C   (feature on remote)

2. You add a commit D and push
A --- B --- C --- D   (feature: yours)


Remote now has D. Your teammate pulls it.

3. You rebase locally on main

Let’s say main got new commits (X), so you do:

git checkout feature
git rebase main


Your D commit is rewritten as D' (a new commit with a different ID).

main:   A --- B --- X --- Y
feature:                D'

4. You push with --force

To update remote with your rebased branch, you run:

git push origin feature --force


Now the remote looks like this:

A --- B --- X --- Y --- D'   (feature on remote)

5. Your teammate’s problem

Your teammate already has commit D (old history).
When they pull, Git sees:

Remote branch has D'.

Local branch has D.

Git thinks these are two different commits (because rebase changed the hash).

They end up with duplicated commits or nasty conflicts.
They’ll have to do a manual fix (interactive rebase or reset) just to sync up with you.

🔑 Key takeaway

Rebase changes commit IDs (history).

If that history is already shared, teammates’ histories no longer match.

That’s why rebasing shared branches is dangerous.

✅ Safe rule:

Rebase before push → ✔ fine (history isn’t shared yet).

Merge after push → ✔ safe (history is already public).
