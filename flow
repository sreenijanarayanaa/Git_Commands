=> many developers use to push changes quickly from IDE terminal:

git add . && git commit -m "your message here" && git push origin branch-name

git add . && git commit -m "Fix: updated MyService logic" && git push origin main


This does:

git add . → stages all modified files

git commit -m "..." → commits with your message

git push origin main → pushes to remote

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🗂️ 1. Local Repository (your desk drawer)

This is your personal project copy on your laptop.

Whatever you do (create, edit, delete files) happens here first.

📋 2. Staging Area (a “To-Do Basket”)

Imagine you don’t want to send all the files you changed.

The staging area is like a basket where you pick and place only the files you want to commit.

Command:

git add file1.java → puts that file in the basket.

git add . → puts all changed files in the basket.

📦 3. Commit (a snapshot)

Once your basket is ready, git commit takes a photo snapshot of what’s in the basket.

This snapshot is stored in your local repo (on your laptop).

🌍 4. Remote Repository (a cloud locker like GitHub)

The remote repo is like Google Drive for code.

Other developers can access it.

Command:

git push origin main → sends your local commits (snapshots) to GitHub.

git pull origin main → brings others’ commits from GitHub to your local repo.

👉 So the flow is:
Working Directory (your files) → git add → Staging Area → git commit → Local Repo → git push → Remote Repo (GitHub).

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🔍 1. Commit = Snapshot of changes

When you git commit, Git saves a snapshot of your staged files inside your local repository.

This snapshot contains:

The file versions (at that moment).

A commit ID (hash) (unique fingerprint).

Metadata like author, timestamp, and message.

Think of it like writing a page in your personal “project diary” — it’s safe in your laptop’s Git history.

🌍 2. Push = Copy your commits to remote

When you run git push origin main:

Git looks at your local commits that don’t exist in the remote repo yet.

It copies those commit snapshots to GitHub.

After push → GitHub now has the same snapshots you had locally.

👥 3. How others see it

Once commits are in the remote repo:

Other developers can git pull → they get your commit snapshots into their local repos.

Their working directory updates automatically to reflect those changes (files, lines, deletions, additions).

✅ So in short:

Commit = Save snapshot locally.

Push = Send those snapshots to GitHub.

Pull = Bring others’ snapshots from GitHub to you.


🔹 1. Snapshot ≠ Flat Image

When we say “snapshot,” it’s only an analogy.
A Git commit is not literally a picture — it’s a structured record of:

The exact state of every file (content, lines, changes).

Links to the previous commit (so Git knows history).

A unique commit ID.

So a commit actually contains the real file versions, not just an image.

🔹 2. How changes “travel” to remote

Your working directory: real files you edit.

You git add → Git copies those file contents into the staging area.

You git commit → Git stores those file contents + history into the local repo database (.git folder).

You git push → Git takes those commits (file contents + history) and transfers them to the remote repo database on GitHub.

Now GitHub’s repo has the same commits (same snapshots of files) as your local repo.

🔹 3. How it “reflects” on GitHub

GitHub is basically just showing the files as they exist in the latest commit.
So when you push, GitHub updates its view to match your new commit — which is why your changes appear in the repo.

✅ In simple words:

Commit = a stored version of files (with content).

Push = sending that stored version to GitHub.

GitHub then displays the files from that commit → which is why your edits show up.

Would you like me to open up a commit object (show what Git actually stores inside a commit) so you see it’s more than just a “photo”?

🔧 Step-by-step Fix Process
1. Create a hotfix branch from the deployed branch

Suppose your deployment is from main:

git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b hotfix/fix-login-bug

2. Fix the code

Make changes in your IDE (fix the buggy file).

3. Stage, commit, push the fix
git add .
git commit -m "Hotfix: fixed login bug after deployment"
git push origin hotfix/fix-login-bug

4. Deploy instantly (two options)

If your team uses PR (Pull Request) workflow → create a PR from hotfix/fix-login-bug → merge → redeploy.

If it’s urgent and you can push directly:

git checkout main
git merge hotfix/fix-login-bug
git push origin main


Then redeploy main.

5. Tag the fix (optional but good practice)

This helps track what got deployed:

git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Hotfix for login bug"
git push origin v1.0.1


✅ This way, the fix is applied instantly, and history is clean.

👉 Quick hack (not recommended for big teams, but fast for small projects):
If the bug is small and you are okay pushing directly to deployed branch:

git checkout main
# fix code
git add .
git commit -m "Quick fix after deployment"
git push origin main


Then redeploy.
